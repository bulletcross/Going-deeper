# yet-another-ml-lectures

> I have started providing some sessions(very informal) on machine learning to my fellow classmates who needed help with it. I mostly focus on mathematics and programming in pytorch. I will update my notes on a weakly basis after my session.

## Books I follow(strictly) to prepare the lecture notes
* [MML-book](https://mml-book.github.io/book/mml-book.pdf)
* [math4ml](https://gwthomas.github.io/docs/math4ml.pdf)
* [Deep Learning Book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)
* [Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/d2l-en.pdf)
* [DiDL code](https://github.com/dsgiitr/d2l-pytorch)

## Week 4
* Introduction and the expectation from these sessions.
* Difference between classical ML approach and Deep learning approach. pros and cons.
* Importance of intuitive understanding by having basic math knowledge.
* Practical approach and importance of coding excersise. Gap between theory and practical implementation.
